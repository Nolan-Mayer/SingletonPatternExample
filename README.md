# SingletonPatternExample

//Nolan Mayer//

This repository demonstrates a singleton logging class which utilizes a thread-safe linear data structure (in this case I used a LinkedBlockingQue but we could have used other data structures)
This repository was partially written by the professor and my job was to implement a thread safe solution using a singleton design pattern.
This was written in JAVA, IDE Replit.
